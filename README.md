# Stuck in space
Captain! I have some bad news your spaceship has been damaged while we were flying and we had to make an emergency landing! I tried to fix it, but I don't have the necessary resources, please operate this drill, and bring me this resources so I can fix your ship!
For information on how to play please visit the README. 

# Gameplay
- You move around with your drill using WASD, be careful **each move uses 1 water and if you run out the game is over!**
- You collect the minerals by drilling to them (you need to be on top of them), remember **you can collect only one type of mineral at the same time** (You can see how full is your pocket in the left corner of the game window).
- To drop the minerals go near your ship, they will be instantly available for your builds and you, water is an exemption because you first use the one in your pocket (after that you wirelessly take it from the ship).
- If there isn't any minerals in your current chunk you can go to the next one (by moving out off bounds of the canvas from the left or right), don't worry the saved in the memory so if you build something it will still remain build.
- In the new chunks there are teleporters (only for minerals) to your original ship in the shape of the ship, you can deposit your minerals also to them.

# Building
Another important part of the game is the building mechanic. You have 4 structures: the coal plant, wind turbine, solar farm and the refinery.
- To place a building:
    - First **left click** on the hammer in the left bottom of the screen
    - It will expand, now you have to **drag and drop** the icon to where you want to place it.
    - While drag and dropping you can see what a structure does and what it costs under "Requirements".
- The coal plant and the refinery don’t have an upfront cost, but they cost minerals per turn to operate.
- The wind turbine and the solar farm have a 30 Aluminum cost at the start, but then produce free energy without any cost in minerals.
- You can destroy a building by **right clicking** on it.
- **Also here is a table of all the structures available in the game:**

| | Coal power plant | refinery (the anvil)  | wind turbine | solar farm |
| :------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------: |
| Upfront cost | None | None | 30 Aluminum | 30 Aluminum |
| Operation cost  | 1 coal/second  | 2 Bauxite/second and 5 Energy/second | Needs wind* | Needs sun* |
| Produces | 1 energy/second | 1 Aluminum/second | 1 energy/second | 1 energy/second |

* I don't want to make the game to slow so please assume the wind always blows with full power and its constantly day (you are stuck on a planet that rotates in sync with its orbit).
  
# How to win?
- To win you have to collect 75 units of Aluminum, 150 units of Oil and 400 units of Energy and come close to your ship.
